Zoning Data after RPA peer review

Maximum residential dwelling units per acre (maxDUA) and Maximum Nonresidential Floor to Area Ratio (maxFAR)
for each zoning district

Census Blocks were intersected with zoning districts and assigned the maxDUA and maxFAR of the zone with the largest
areal overlap of the block.
Then, Blocks were intersected with the non-developable land constraints layer to remove areas that are protected/restricted
for development.
