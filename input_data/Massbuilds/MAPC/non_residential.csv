The project is the construction of a wastewater Management Facility, approximately 9,600 square feet in size, with landscaping, parking, lighting, and drainage improvements on a parcel of land at 67 A Street.The East Framingham Sewer Improvement Project (EFSIP) includes the construction of a new gravity sewer on Concord Street from Old Connecticut Path to Arthur Street and within the former railroad right-of-way from Speen Street to School Street.  It also includes the construction of a new force main sewer from A Street to Old Connecticut Path.  This project will eliminate three sewer pump stations and several miles of force main, one of the largest contributors of sulfides in the Town'ss sewer system.  In addition, this project will eliminate several sanitary sewer overflows which constitute Clean Water Act violations and pose a threat to human health and the environment.In addition to the utility work, this project will develop the former railroad right-of-way into a recreational pathway that will also allow for operational access to the sewer pipe.  This work includes the construction of a new multi-use trail beginning at the northern terminus located at School Street, continuing along the abandoned railroad corridor before terminating at Cochituate Road (Route 30), a distance of approximately 1.5 miles.  The work includes a new hot mix bituminous asphalt trail, trail pull-offs, construction of two new pre-engineered bridges, an at-grade crossing of Old Connecticut Path, a crossing of the TJX entrance and a crossing of the Luchetti driveway.Completion of the EFSIP improvements is required under the terms of the Administrative Consent Order (ACO) with the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (MADEP).  The sewer work proposed under this project has been preliminarily approved for low interest loans under the MADEP State Revolving Fund (SRF).  The project is also eligible for American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) stimulus funding provided that the construction contracts are in place prior to February 17, 2010.The facility was sited based on a thorough alternatives analysis.  In addition to significantly reducing the amount of wastewater that crosses the Sudbury River, sitting the facility on the south side of the river eliminates the need for a siphon which would be problematic to maintain.  The ability to eliminate the Speen Street pump station could also only be accomplished if the proposed WWMF is located within a very narrow geographical area that meets the topographical constraints to allow gravity flow from the existing Speen Street station to Saxonville.  In addition to meeting the topographical constraints, the proposed location does not require the acquisition of any non-town owned property.  Locating the facility closer to the High School parking lot was considered, but the construction and operability issues associated with making the wetwell even deeper make that infeasible.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,14

With the changes, the Open Space Area on the Parking Lot increases from .04 to .27.    Changes to the Parking Lot include the installation of a new drainage system, significant landscaping and the elimination of one driveway on Waverly Street.The totality of the changes to the site result in the Project being in compliance after the issuance of the Zoning Board of Appealsâ€™ Decisions, with the requirements of the By-Law, except for the location of the parking spaces for the Restaurant Facility across Waverly Street and the need for a Special Permit for the increase in Restaurant Operations.  As depicted on the Site Plan, 122 parking spaces are provided for the Restaurant Operations, as modified, and the existing Barber Shop, as required under the By-Law.  The Plans also include the upgrading of the building facade.  Safety is also improved through the elimination of one of the driveways along Waverly Street.  In discussions of the Board, concerns were noted for the crossing of Waverly Street.  It was noted there is an existing street light in the area of the driveway and crossing area.  As a result of comments from the Planning Board, the Plan was revised to include Bollard lighting and signage to direct customers along the sidewalk to the crosswalk at the Winter Street intersection.  It was also noted that the Massachusetts Highway Department is in the process of making improvements to the Winter Street intersection and plans to move the crosswalk closer to the Restaurant Operations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,6

Construction of a new building for the use as an early childhood development center, classrooms and a library, and off-street parking on the property located at 848 Central Street and Kellogg Street.The proposed project is the demolition of an existing building on Kellogg Street (the building is not numbered, but is adjacent to 62 Kellogg Street) and the construction of a new, larger building in the same location.  The existing building is a converted barn, and is no longer suitable to accommodate the needs of The Learning Center.  The building was constructed in 1878 of post and beam construction, and is no longer structurally sound.  The HVAC system is antiquated and not in compliance with applicable energy codes.  The building also is not in compliance with ADA regulations.  The Board was told that it was determined that it would not be feasible to attempt to renovate and expand the existing building. The existing building has a footprint of 4,593 square feet and a gross floor area of 9,186 square feet.  The proposed building will have a footprint of approximately 9,875 square feet and a gross floor area of approximately 19,750 square feet.  The building will be used by The Learning Center as an early childhood development center and will contain classrooms and related facilities, and will also contain a library.  The new building will be fully accessible and will comply with all applicable codes and regulations.The other component of the project is the construction of a new, off-street parking lot.  The parking lot will have a single entrance/exit on Kellogg Street, and will contain 35 parking spaces.  In order to minimize drainage impacts, a portion of the parking lot will be constructed with a new type of porous pavement known as Flexi-Pave.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,116

The Project will be completed in a single phase and will comply with the Affordable Housing Requirements provided in Section 11.11 of the Woburn Zoning Ordinance. The parking areas will provide 435 total spaces in two locations:15 surface spaces to serve the retail area, as well as a structured parking facility of 420 spaces. The Property benefits from excellent accessibility to major transportation modes. Directly south of the site is the Anderson Regional Transportation Center where users can commute to downtown Boston on the MBTA Commuter Rail in 25 minutes, ride the Amtrak to a variety of more distant destinations, or take the Logan Express for an express route to Logan International Airport. To the east is the I-93 onramp, providing access to one of the region’s most traveled highways. Abutting the site to the west is the location for the planned New Boston Street bridge project. MAPC’s 2018 eTOD Woburn Plan outlines this site as critical for housing and TOD. The proposed development will be harmonious with these goals by delivering transit- oriented housing to the area.Private open space is provided to the residents within an interior courtyard featuring a pool, built-in grilling stations, and other common recreational features that may include hammocks, arbors, and putting greens. On the interior, other residential common amenities would likely include a welcome/front desk area, lounge, business center, and space for a package concierge service.The Project site is between the future New Boston Street Bridge and the Anderson RTC and could prove to be an important connectivity node between the two.
