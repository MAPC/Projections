The parking areas will provide 435 total spaces in two locations:15 surface spaces to serve the retail area, as well as a structured parking facility of 420 spaces. The Property benefits from excellent accessibility to major transportation modes. Directly south of the site is the Anderson Regional Transportation Center where users can commute to downtown Boston on the MBTA Commuter Rail in 25 minutes, ride the Amtrak to a variety of more distant destinations, or take the Logan Express for an express route to Logan International Airport. To the east is the I-93 onramp, providing access to one of the region’s most traveled highways. Abutting the site to the west is the location for the planned New Boston Street bridge project. MAPC’s 2018 eTOD Woburn Plan outlines this site as critical for housing and TOD. The proposed development will be harmonious with these goals by delivering transit- oriented housing to the area.Private open space is provided to the residents within an interior courtyard featuring a pool, built-in grilling stations, and other common recreational features that may include hammocks, arbors, and putting greens. On the interior, other residential common amenities would likely include a welcome/front desk area, lounge, business center, and space for a package concierge service.The Project site is between the future New Boston Street Bridge and the Anderson RTC and could prove to be an important connectivity node between the two.
