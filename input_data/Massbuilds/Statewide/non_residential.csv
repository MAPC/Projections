The project is  zoned Single Family Residental District (R-1).  Said parcel is shown on the Framingham Assessor's Sheet 276, Block 151, Lot 9.   The project is the construction of a wastewater Management Facility, approximately 9,600 square feet in size, with landscaping, parking, lighting, and drainage improvements on a parcel of land at 67 A Street.The East Framingham Sewer Improvement Project (EFSIP) includes the construction of a new gravity sewer on Concord Street from Old Connecticut Path to Arthur Street and within the former railroad right-of-way from Speen Street to School Street.  It also includes the construction of a new force main sewer from A Street to Old Connecticut Path.  This project will eliminate three sewer pump stations and several miles of force main, one of the largest contributors of sulfides in the Town'ss sewer system.  In addition, this project will eliminate several sanitary sewer overflows which constitute Clean Water Act violations and pose a threat to human health and the environment.In addition to the utility work, this project will develop the former railroad right-of-way into a recreational pathway that will also allow for operational access to the sewer pipe.  This work includes the construction of a new multi-use trail beginning at the northern terminus located at School Street, continuing along the abandoned railroad corridor before terminating at Cochituate Road (Route 30), a distance of approximately 1.5 miles.  The work includes a new hot mix bituminous asphalt trail, trail pull-offs, construction of two new pre-engineered bridges, an at-grade crossing of Old Connecticut Path, a crossing of the TJX entrance and a crossing of the Luchetti driveway.Completion of the EFSIP improvements is required under the terms of the Administrative Consent Order (ACO) with the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (MADEP).  The sewer work proposed under this project has been preliminarily approved for low interest loans under the MADEP State Revolving Fund (SRF).  The project is also eligible for American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) stimulus funding provided that the construction contracts are in place prior to February 17, 2010.The facility was sited based on a thorough alternatives analysis.  In addition to significantly reducing the amount of wastewater that crosses the Sudbury River, sitting the facility on the south side of the river eliminates the need for a siphon which would be problematic to maintain.  The ability to eliminate the Speen Street pump station could also only be accomplished if the proposed WWMF is located within a very narrow geographical area that meets the topographical constraints to allow gravity flow from the existing Speen Street station to Saxonville.  In addition to meeting the topographical constraints, the proposed location does not require the acquisition of any non-town owned property.  Locating the facility closer to the High School parking lot was considered, but the construction and operability issues associated with making the wetwell even deeper make that infeasible.",14,FALSE

The project is zoned Restaurant use at the property located at 911 and 921 Waverly Street, zoned General Manufacturing (M) and to provide parking at 904 and 920 Waverly Street zoned Business (B).  The premises are shown on Framingham Assessors Plan Sheet 149, Block 306, Lots 3 and 4 and Sheet 124, Block 253, Lots 2 and 15.  the Plan includes the construction of an addition to the Restaurant facility.  The addition consists of approximately 3,494 square feet. In addition to the expansion, additional space is being added as a result of the expansion of the second floor.   The second floor was expanded approximately 8 feet along the front of the building.  The total area of the addition and the second floor (346 square feet) results in a total increase of 3,840 square feet.  The second floor is being converted to a function area with 90 seats accessed by the elevator being installed in the addition.As a result of the changes to the Restaurant Lot, the building area increased from 10,644 square feet to 14,448 square feet, thereby establishing a Floor Area Ratio of .7,(existing F.A.R. of .52), as authorized by the Zoning Board of Appeals.  The changes will also result in an increase in the seating for the Restaurant patrons of 43 and an increase in the function seating for 4 patrons.Changes to the property located at 904 and 920 Waverly Street (Parking Lot) are also proposed.  The design for the parking area of the Parking Lot is in full compliance of the By-Law.  The changes to the Parking Lot also include the demolition of the existing automobile repair facility.   With the changes, the Open Space Area on the Parking Lot increases from .04 to .27.    Changes to the Parking Lot include the installation of a new drainage system, significant landscaping and the elimination of one driveway on Waverly Street.The totality of the changes to the site result in the Project being in compliance after the issuance of the Zoning Board of Appealsâ€™ Decisions, with the requirements of the By-Law, except for the location of the parking spaces for the Restaurant Facility across Waverly Street and the need for a Special Permit for the increase in Restaurant Operations.  As depicted on the Site Plan, 122 parking spaces are provided for the Restaurant Operations, as modified, and the existing Barber Shop, as required under the By-Law.  The Plans also include the upgrading of the building facade.  Safety is also improved through the elimination of one of the driveways along Waverly Street.  In discussions of the Board, concerns were noted for the crossing of Waverly Street.  It was noted there is an existing street light in the area of the driveway and crossing area.  As a result of comments from the Planning Board, the Plan was revised to include Bollard lighting and signage to direct customers along the sidewalk to the crosswalk at the Winter Street intersection.  It was also noted that the Massachusetts Highway Department is in the process of making improvements to the Winter Street intersection and plans to move the crosswalk closer to the Restaurant Operations.",6,FALSE

Residential properties arelocated east of the railroad that abuts the eastern parcel boundary, however the residential propertiesare  not  anticipated to  be  impacted  by  the  proposed  Project  as  the  existing  railroad  creates  a  distinct  barrier between the Project Site and residential properties. Please refer to Figure 1 and 2 in Attachment 1 for a USGS and Aerial map of the Project Site. In the Project Site’s low-lying areas, primarily along the eastern and southern property line are several streams and culverts, including an unnamed Tributary to Wellington Brook, large areas of both federally regulated  and  unregulated  wetlands,  and  Chimney  Pond.  Chimney  Pond  is  an  impounded pond  that  appears to  have  been  dammed  in  the  1800s.  A  wetland delineation  was  completed  in  April  2021 that noted  the  dam  was  in  good  condition. However,  following  the  original  delineation,  in August  2021,  it the dam was found to be leaking through the former waterpower generation sluiceway located on the northeast side of the dam approximately 130 feet southeast of the pond spillway. The  Project  Site  contains  flood  zone  A  on  the  eastern  portion. An  electrical  right-of-way owned  by National  Grid  is  located  in  the  northern portion  of  the  property.  Mapped Natural  Heritage  and  Endangered  Species  Program habitat  is  located  within  the  boundary  of  the  National Grid easement on the northern edge  of  the  Project  Site,  however  the  limit  of  work  for  the  proposed Project will  not  fall  within  the  National  Grid  right-of-way  nor  the  endangered  species  habitat.  Please  refer  to  Figure  3  in Attachment 1 for an Environmental Constraints map.According to   the   MassGIS   2020   Environmental   Justice   Populations   mapping,   there   are   two   Environmental  Justice  Populations  within a  1-mile radius of the Project Site. Please  refer to Figure 4 in Attachment 1 for the Environmental Justice Map. They are Block Group 5, Census Tract 7531 and Block Group 3, Census Tract 7365, both in Worcester County. The Project Site borders Block Group 5, Census Tract 7531 but the Project Site is not located within an Environmental Justice Population. Block Group 5, Census  Tract  7531,  is  an  Environmental  Justice  Population  based  on  the  Minority  criteria.  The  block  group’s  median  household  income  is  $101,848,  which  is  118%  of  the  MA  median.  The  total  minority  population  within  this  block  group is  29.3%.  Block  Group  3,  Census  Tract  7365,  is  an  Environmental  Justice  Population  based  on  the  Income criteria. The Block Group’s  median  household  income  is  $48,219,  which  is  56.2%  of  the MA  median.  The  total  minority  population  in  this  Block Group  is  2.6%. Given  the  Project  Site’s  nearly immediate access  to  I-395,  separation  from  residential  properties, and the nature of the activities proposed for the site, the Proponent expects that impacts from the Project will generally be confined to the immediate Project Site and will not disproportionally adversely affect nearby EJ populations.-  4 - The Proponentcontactedthe EJ Office withinthe ExecutiveOffice of Energy and Environmental AffairsEnvironmental (EEA) Justice group which provided a list of Community-Based Organizations (CBO) in the area that may be interested in the proposed Project.

Figure 1in Attachment A shows the Project location. The Project site is identified as Parcel ID 14-114-23. It is onthe west side of Cape Road immediately north of its intersection with Whitten Street, a private roadthat extends west from Cape Road approximately 1,600 feet where it ends in a cul-de-sac. Access to thesite is will be from Whitten Street.The Project site is in Highway Business (HB) Zone in which ‘Wholesale business and storage providedthere is no manufacturing or processing of materials’ is a permitted use with a Special Permit for ‘Anybusiness and/or retail use permitted above by right in excess of 10,000 square feet of building area’.The stretch of Cape Road north of the Project site is a mix of commercial and some residential uses. Thesingle-runway Hopedale airport is located less than 1,000 feet north of the Project Site. The airport hasa small industrial/office park associated with it. There is a gas station on the south side of Whitten Streetat the Cape Road intersection. Beyond the gas station, the corridor is primarily residential, however,there is a large car auction facility approximately 0.6 miles to the south at the Mendon-Bellinghamborder.Structures immediately adjacent to the site include a 3-building complex comprising a car wash andauto service center, both of which front on Cape Road immediately north of Whitten Street. A gasstation and an equipment rental business front on Cape Street, immediately south of Whitten Street.The Project site is set back from Cape Road behind (i.e., west of) the businesses that front on Cape Road.The Project site consists of disturbed/cleared land on the north and south sides of Whitten Street. Thesite is scattered with piles of old asphalt, wood chips, as well as piles of rock and dirt. The Project site isshown on an aerial photo in Figure 2 in Attachment A.The topography of the site slopes east to west from an elevation of approximately 288 feet near CapeRoad down to approximately 213 feet at the western limit of the property.There are wetlands at the western edge of the site which have some associated floodplain (Zone X, 0.2%chance of annual flooding). The wetlands have been delineated and are shown on the proposed siteplan (Figure 6, Attachment A). The buffer zones are also shown on the site plan, including the local 25-foot No Disturb Zone and 50-foot No Build Zone, and the State 100-foot Buffer Zone. The site is notwithin an Area of Critical Environmental Concern (ACEC), and it does not contain any rare specieshabitat.The Project is not expected to generate greater than 150 diesel truck trips per day. Therefore, itsdesignated geographic area (DGA) is just one mile. There are no Environmental Justice (EJ) populationswithin one mile of the Project site.-4-Describe the proposed project and its programmatic and physical elements:The proposed Project consists of the construction of a 1-story, 35-foot tall, approximately 205,445square-foot warehouse building (including 5,832 sf of office space) and 226 parking spaces (206 vehicleand 20 trailer parking spaces). The building will be sited on the western portion of the site off the endof the existing cul-de-sac on Whitten Street. A driveway will ring the building to provide access to allsides of the building.Access to the Project will be from the Whitten Street right-of-way. Given the low volume of trafficexpected to be generated, no improvements are expected to be required at the intersection of WhittenStreet and Cape Road.The Project will be a net fill site, requiring approximately 92,000 cy of fill to be brought to the site. TheProject avoids the 25-foot No Disturb Zone from the BVW and requires only grading and stormwaterinfrastructure within the 100-foot Buffer zone.The Project will include a new stormwater management system, designed in accordance with MassDEPStormwater Management Standards (please refer to the Stormwater Section on page 6 for more detail).The Project will include four on-site domestic water supply wells proposed to be located east of thebuilding and parking, north of Whitten Street, and west of the car wash/auto service buildings as shownon Figure 6 in Attachment A. The new 6-inch diameter bedrock wells were constructed by MaherServices (driller) to a depth of 425 feet between May 14 and May 18, 2022. The four wells are estimatedto have a yield ranging from 5 to 20 gallons per minute (gpm) (demand is only 1.5 gpm). Three of thewells will be pumped to obtain an approval and the fourth used as a spare. Water quality tests havebeen done and are favorable. The average iron concentration is above the secondary contaminant level,but usable without treatment, and the average pH is slightly over 7, which is within the range of 6.5 to8.5 allowed by MassDEP. The wells will be connected to the building via service line below the proposedparking area and access driveway.The Project will use an on-site septic system for wastewater disposal. The septic system is proposed tobe constructed east of the proposed building and parking and south of Whitten Street with a reserveadditional septic area on the north side of Whitten Street if needed. The reserve area will be set backgreater than 100 feet from the proposed water supply well in accordance with regulations. The septicsystem will be reviewed and approved on the local level by the Mendon Board of Health.The Project will include landscaping to improve the aesthetics of what is now a degraded site and toprovide some screening from adjacent land uses.",146,FALSE
